# RDM-Clicker
Simple randomized autoclicker with a nice GUI. This isn't a regular toggle autoclicker, it clicks until you stop holding button. 

Bind the mouse keys to F21 for left click and F22 for right click (razer synapse, logitech ghub...)

If you click the "close" button of the window, the program will be minimized, not killed. If you want to show it again after pressing close, or kill the program, you can right click the tray icon.

The Up-Down delay is the delay between the key being pressed and the key being released, some games dont detect clicks if too low. Dont input fancy things like negative numbers into this field.
