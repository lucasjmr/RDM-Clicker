# RDM-Clicker
Randomized Autoclicker (HOLD)

Bind the mouse keys to F21 for left click and F22 for right click (razer synapse, logitech ghub...)

If you click the "close" button of the window, the program will be minimized, not killed. If you want to show it again after pressing close, or kill the program, you can right click the tray icon.
