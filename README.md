# RDM-Clicker

![alt text](https://github.com/lucasjmr/RDM-Clicker/blob/main/RDM-clicker.png?raw=true)

Simple randomized autoclicker with a nice GUI. This isn't a regular toggle autoclicker, it clicks until you stop holding button. 

It uses Mouse button 5 and 4 (side buttons) of your mouse.

If you click the "close" button of the window, the program will be minimized, not killed. If you want to show it again after pressing close, or kill the program, you can right click the tray icon.

The Up-Down delay is the delay between the click being pressed and the click being released, some games dont detect clicks if too low. Dont input fancy things like negative numbers into this field.
